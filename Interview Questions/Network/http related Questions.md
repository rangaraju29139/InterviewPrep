#  http related interview questions


 ## 1. What is HTTP?
This is one of the most common questions to start an interview. The hiring manager may ask you this to check your broader perspective of HTTP. Consider giving a comprehensive answer, referring to HTTP in full form, and discussing use case and importance. Try to keep your answer precise.
### Example: HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. It's a type of networking protocol in the IP suite used for shared and hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the basis of data communication on the World Wide Web (WWW). It facilitates the transfer of hypertext from the client to the server.

## 2. Tell me three basic features of HTTP.
This kind of question tests your basic understanding of HTTP. While answering this question, briefly mention three basic and important HTTP features.
### Example: Three basic features that make HTTP simple and powerful are that it's a connectionless protocol, which means the browser submits the request and the client then disconnects from the server. The client waits for a response after disconnecting. HTTP is media independent, and it can transport any data type if both the client and server are able to handle the data content. Because HTTP is connectionless, it's also stateless. Client and server are aware of each other only during the connected period and once the connection ends, data is not retained by either party.

## 3. What are HTTP request methods?
The interviewer wants to assess your theoretical knowledge of HTTP with this question. In your answer, consider listing all the request methods of HTTP.
### Example: HTTP consists of a set of request methods that specify the action that a particular resource requires. The nine HTTP request methods are GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE and PATCH.

## 4. What is URI?
This is another question that tests your basic knowledge of HTTP. You can start by mentioning what URI stands for, followed by its general application.
### Example: URI stands for uniform resource identifier. URIs define the identity of anything, including information resources such as web pages available on the internet and distinguishes one resource from another.

## 5. Describe HTTP requests and HTTP responses.
The interviewer often includes this to examine your knowledge of fundamental technical concepts in network administration. While answering, explain HTTP requests and responses in simple terms.
### Example: HTTP messages how a server and a client exchange data. There are two types of messages, including requests that the client submits to initiate an action on the server and responses that are the answer from the server.

## 6. Explain the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.
Interviewers usually include this to check your familiarity with fundamental concepts and your ability to explain the difference accurately. You can briefly describe both terms and highlight the core difference between them.
### Example: HTTPS stands for hypertext transfer protocol secure and is HTTP with encryption. The primary difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS encrypts all HTTP requests and responses using TLS (SSL), making HTTPS more secure than HTTP.
